With this pie chart, we can define a list of colors which is used for the
pieces. A counter cycles through the list for choosing the color, it restarts
after the list ended.

The annotation is done using the pin element.

This example was written by Henri Menke answering a question of Sascha
on TeXwelt.de: http://texwelt.de/wissen/fragen/4965/
